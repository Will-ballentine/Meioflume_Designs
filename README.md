# The Meioflume
The meioflume is a small scale flow chamber designed to enable the interstitial observations of Meiofauna. When connected to a syring-press (or any mothod of flow generation), fluid can be propegated through a bed of pourus media in a restricted (28.57 x 10.16 x 1 mm) working area that allows for bottom illumination and clear visualization of the fauna within.
